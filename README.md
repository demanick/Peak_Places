This repositiory contains a project completed for my Projects in Programming and Data Science class taken during the fall semester
of my junior year. The project consists of a script which collects weather and locaiton data on the highest point in each of the
50 states, hence the name peak places.

The DarkSky weather API is used to collect weahter data and the Google Maps API is used to gather location data.
